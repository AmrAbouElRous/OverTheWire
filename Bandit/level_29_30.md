## üí° Tips
```bash
The basic commands for working with branches are:

    git branch: List (-a), create, or delete branches
    git checkout <branch_name>/git switch <branch_name>: Switch branches
    git merge: Join two or more branches

I found using "git log --all --graph" is easier for me. It will list out all branches you have in graph representation on the terminal.
