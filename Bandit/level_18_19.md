## üí° Tips

In the walkthrough to Level 0 I have given a short introduction to SSH. Something I have not mentioned is that SSH does not just allows us to log into a machine remotely, but it also allows remote execution of commands by adding the commands after the common SSH expression.
```bash
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 /bin/bash
```
