# Bandit Level 31 ‚Üí Level 32

## üß† Goal

There is a git repository at ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit31-git is the same as for the user bandit31.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

Note: switching to '9f2814daa679b29d2c8f78f2766e7e9332445a41'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 9f2814d initial commit

## üí° Tips
A little bit of Theory

The introduction to Git can be found in Level 28 and Level 29.

Git Commit saves the currently made changes with a message describing these changes. The flag -a makes sure all modified/deleted files are staged but it should be tracked first.
‚úÖ git commit -a auto-stages:

    Changes to already tracked files (files you previously added with git add).

    That includes modifications and deletions.

‚ùå git commit -a does NOT auto-stage:

    Brand new files (untracked files ‚Äî ones Git has never seen before).

‚úî Final Answer:

    Using git add . with git commit -m is more comprehensive than git commit -a -m, because it includes new files too.

Git Push updates local changes in remote repositories. When pushing for the first time, you should also define the branch with -u.
‚úÖ Summary:

| Command                       | Use case                               |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `git push -u origin <branch>` | First time pushing that branch         |
| `git push`                    | After upstream is set (thanks to `-u`) |


Git Ignore is a file with the filename ‚Äò.gitignore‚Äô. In this file, all file names/extensions that should be ignored by the commit are written. This means if a file which is in the ignore file is created/changed, it will not be part of the commit/repository. Git ignore also allows for wildcards. (For example, : ‚Äò*.pyc‚Äô means all files with the ending ‚Äò.pyc‚Äô will be ignored.) There are pre-written files for specific situations and languages, like this one for Python.

Git Add updates what files will be part of the next commit. The -f flag forces files to be able to be committed, even when they are normally ignored.

‚úÖ git add .

    What it does: Stages all changes in the current directory and subdirectories, including:

        Modified tracked files

        Deleted tracked files

        New untracked files (except ignored ones)

    Won't include: Files listed in .gitignore (ignored files)

‚úÖ git add -f <file_name>

    -f means force.

    What it does: Stages a file even if it's ignored (i.e., listed in .gitignore).
    
‚úÖ Summary:

| Command             | Purpose                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `git add .`         | Adds all changes (except ignored files) |
| `git add -f <file>` | Adds even ignored files (forced)        |


‚úÖ If you delete .gitignore, then:

    Git will no longer ignore the files listed in it.

    So, previously ignored files (like .env, node_modules/, etc.) will now be seen as untracked files.

    That means you can add them with git add or git add . normally, without needing -f.
